# Leap Menu

This is the repo for my Interactive Leap Motion Menu

### Get Set Up!
```bash
# install UNITY(Unity 5.5)

# clone & setup
git clone https://github.com/JKirkYuan/LeapMenu.git && cd Leap_Menu

# Find the Scene
Go into Assets > LeapMotion > Scenes > Buttons_Scene.unity
Double click and you have everything setup!

```
### Testing
Currently does not work for MacOS because Leap Motion Orion is *currently* only available for Windows
